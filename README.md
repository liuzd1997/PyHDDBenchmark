# A Python-Based Framework for Magnetic-Head Positioning Control Systems in Hard Disk Drives

This project serves as a Python adaptation of the Hard Disk Drive Servo Control Benchmark: "Magnetic-head Positioning Control System in HDDs," authored by Takenori Atsumi in MATLAB under the Investigating R&D Committee on “Precision Servo Technology for High Value-Added Mechatronic System,” The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.  The Matlab source material can be found on the MATLAB Central File Exchange, uploaded in 2024, and is available through the following link: [Magnetic-head Positioning Control System in HDDs](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/111515-magnetic-head-positioning-control-system-in-hdds).

The adaptation is inspired by and based on the research and methodologies outlined in the reference paper by T. Atsumi and S. Yabui, titled "Quadruple-Stage Actuator System for Magnetic-Head Positioning System in HDDs." This paper was published in The IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Volume 67, Issue 11, on pages 9184-9194, in November 2020.

# HDD Benchmark Problem Simulation and Analysis

The organization and content of this repository are inspired by a Matlab reference structure, designed to enhance the navigability and understanding of Hard Disk Drive (HDD) benchmark problem simulations and their analyses.

## Installation and Environment Setup

### Environment Requirements
This project is compatible with Python 3.11.0 and was tested with specific package versions:

- numpy 1.23.4
- control 0.9.4
- scipy 1.11.3
- matplotlib 3.7.0

### Setting Up the Environment

Follow these steps to prepare the environment for running the simulations and analyses:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Download the code package and extract its contents.
      ```bash
      https://github.com/macs-lab/PyHDDBenchmark.git
      cd PyHDDBenchmark
      ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Use pip to install the necessary Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Running the Project

To engage with the project's simulation and plotting functionalities, execute the appropriate scripts as follows, depending on your objectives:

- **For Plotting Simulation Results:**
  - Prior execution of the controller simulation is required. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python function_simulation.py
    ```
    Please note that the simulation's execution time may vary depending on your hardware specifications. It could take several minutes to complete.
    Once the simulation has finished running, you can proceed with plotting the results.

  - To visualize frequency responses, execute:
    ```bash
    python plot_control_system.py
    ```
    or disturbance observer
    ```bash
    python plot_control_system_with_DOB.py
    ``` 

  - To compare the frequency responses between the reduced-order plants and the original plants of PZT actuator and VCM, execute:
    ```bash
    python reduce_order_system.py
    ```

  - For simulating the controller and visualizing the results, use the command:
    ```bash
    python simulate_trackfollow.py
    ```

## Simulation Output Directory

Note: All the code execution results, including plots and data files, will be saved in the **`plot_result`** subdirectory and the **`plot_result_ReducedOrder`** subdirectoryby default. If you wish to change the output directory, you can modify the corresponding setting in the `utils.py` file.
