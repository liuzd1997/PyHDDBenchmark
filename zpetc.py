    """
    Zero-phase error tracking compensator
    This class finds an approximate inverse of a model. The inverse is constructed so that the
    phase is correct, but the magnitude may not be, depending on the zeros of the model
    being inverted.
    The resulting approximate inverse model is expressed as:
        z^advance_steps * causal_inverse_model
    where `causal_inverse_model` is a stable causal LTI system and `advance_steps` >= 0.
