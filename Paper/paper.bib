  abstract = {This paper discusses two mechatronic innovations in magnetic hard disk drive servo systems, which may have to be deployed in the near future, in order to sustain the continuing 60% annual increase in storage density of these devices. The first is the use of high bandwidth dual-stage actuator servo systems to improve the precision and track-following capability of the read/write head positioning control system. The second is the instrumentation of disk drive suspensions with vibration sensing strain gages, in order to enhance airflow-induced suspension vibration suppression in hard disk drives.}
